                        In 2003, Elon founded Tesla with the goal of creating an electric car that could compete with traditional gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of performance and range. The company's first car, the Tesla Roadster, was released in 2008 and quickly became a sensation.<br>
                        
                        Tesla continued to innovate, releasing the Model S in 2012, which became one of the most popular electric cars on the market. The company's focus on innovation and sustainability helped to fuel its growth, and in 2020.<br>
                        
                        In addition to its cars, Tesla also produces energy storage solutions and solar panels, furthering its mission to create a sustainable future powered by renewable energy.<br>
                        
                        Through his vision and innovation, Tesla have become synonymous with the future of transportation and energy. The company's electric cars have transformed the automotive industry and helped to pave the way for a more sustainable future.
