                    <h3 class="indent2">Once upon a time, there were two friends, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who shared a passion for photography. They loved taking pictures and sharing them with their friends, but they found the process of sharing photos on existing social media platforms to be cumbersome and unintuitive.<br>

                        In 2010, Kevin and Mike decided to create a photo-sharing app that would allow people to easily edit and share their photos. They called it Instagram.<br>
                        
                        Allowing users to take photos, apply filters, and share them with their followers. It quickly gained popularity among iPhone users and became known for its interface and filters.<br>
                        
                        Instagram continued to grow, adding new features such as video sharing, direct messaging, and the ability to follow hashtags. In 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion, which helped to further accelerate its growth.<br>
                        
                        Today, Instagram has over 1 billion monthly active users and has become a powerful platform for sharing photos. Kevin and Mike's simple idea for a photo-sharing app has become a cultural phenomenon and a vital part of the social media landscape.
