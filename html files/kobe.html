                    <h3 class="indent11">There was a young boy named Kobe Bryant,born in Philadelphia. Kobe was the son of former NBA player Joe "Jellybean" Bryant, and he grew up with a deep love for basketball.<br>

                        In high school, he quickly became one of the top high school players. He decided to forego college and enter the NBA draft in 1996, where he was selected 13th overall pick. However, he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he would spend his entire career.<br>
                        
                        From his early years in the NBA, Kobe showed that he was a special talent. He was known for his incredible ethic, his amazing ability, and his fierce competitiveness. He won five NBA championships, two NBA Finals MVP awards, and was named to the All-Star team 18 times.<br>
                                                  
                        Tragically, Kobe's life was cut short in a helicopter crash in January 2020. However, his  legacy lives on, and he continues to inspire millions of people around the world.<br>
                        
                        Kobe's success can be attributed to his natural talent, his incredible work ethic, and his fierce competitiveness. He never settled for being good enough and always pushed himself to be the best. His incredible achievements on and off the court have made him an inspiration to millions of people around the world.
