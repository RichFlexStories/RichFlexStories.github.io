                    <h3 class="indent8">In the mid-1970s, a young college dropout named Steve Jobs had a vision for a new kind of computer company. Along with his friend Steve Wozniak, he founded Apple Computer, with the goal of creating innovative and user-friendly technology.<br>

                        Apple's first product was the Apple I computer, which was sold as a do-it-yourself kit. The company soon followed up with the Apple II, which was the first personal computer to feature graphics and a keyboard.<br>
                        
                        In the 1980s, Apple introduced the Macintosh, which was the first computer to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. The Macintosh was a game-changer, making computing more accessible for users.<br>
                        
                        Over the years, Apple continued to innovate, introducing new products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which revolutionized the music, smartphone, and tablet markets.<br>
                        
                        Apple's focus on design and user experience has been a hallmark of the company since its inception, and it has helped to establish Apple as one of the most valuable companies in the world.<br>
                        
                        Today, Apple is a global leader in technology, with a market of over $2 trillion. Steve Jobs vision and dedication have helped to shape the modern technology landscape.
