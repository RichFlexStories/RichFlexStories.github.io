                    <h3 class="indent7">In the mid-1970s, a young programmer named Bill Gates had a vision for a new kind of computer software. He believed that personal computers would become an important tool in people's lives, and that there was a need for a user-friendly operating system.<br>

                        In 1981, Microsoft launched its first operating system, MS-DOS, which was designed for early personal computers. However, it was a command-line system making it difficult for many people to use.<br>
                        
                        In 1983, Microsoft began working on a new operating system that would be easier to use and more visually appealing. The new system, which would eventually be called Windows, used a graphical user interface with icons that users could perform tasks.<br>
                        
                        The first version of Windows was released in 1985 and quickly became popular among PC users. Over the years, Microsoft continued to improve Windows, adding features such as internet, media, and enhanced security.<br>
                        
                        Today, Windows is the most used system in the world, with over 1.3 billion devices running on it. Bill Gates' vision for a user-friendly operating system helped to make personal computers accessible to everyone, and Windows has become an essential tool for work and personal use around the world.
