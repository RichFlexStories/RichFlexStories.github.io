                    <h3 class="indent6">Once upon a time, there was a man named Jeff Bezos who was working on Wall Street in New York City. He saw the potential of the internet and realized that it could be used to create a new kind of retail experience.<br>

                        In 1994, Jeff founded Amazon, an online bookstore that would revolutionize the way people shop for books. The company's first office was located in Jeff's garage in Seattle, Washington.<br>
                        
                        Amazon quickly expanded, adding new categories such as music and movies, and branching out into other products such as electronics, clothing, and household. The company's focus on customer service and convenience helped to fuel its growth, and it soon became the largest online retailer in the world.<br>
                        
                        Over the years, Amazon has continued to launch new services such as Amazon Prime, which offers free shipping and other benefits to members.<br>
                        
                        Today, Amazon is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market of over $1.5 trillion. Jeff Bezos' vision and dedication to innovation have transformed the way people shop and have helped to shape the modern retail landscape.<br>
