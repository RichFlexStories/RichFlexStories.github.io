                    <h3 class="indent3">Once upon a time, there was a social media platform called Facebook that allowed people to connect and share information with each other. As Facebook grew in popularity, its creators realized that they needed a more efficient way for users to communicate with each other in real-time.<br>

                        In 2011, Facebook launched a messaging app called Messenger that allowed users to send messages, photos, and videos to their friends and family. The app was initially part of the main Facebook app, but it was later separated into its own standalone app in 2014.<br>
                        
                        Messenger continued to evolve. It quickly became one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, with over 1.3 billion monthly active users.<br>
                        
                        In recent years, Messenger has also been used by businesses to communicate with customers with features.<br>
                        
                        Through its evolution and innovation, Messenger has become an integral part of the social media landscape, providing a fast way for people to stay connected with each other.
